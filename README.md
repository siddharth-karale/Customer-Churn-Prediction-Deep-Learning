# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Deep-Learning

Predicting customer churn for a bank using Artificial Neural Network

This project aims to develop and evaluate a deep learning model, specifically an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to predict customer churn in the banking industry. By identifying customers at risk of leaving, banks can implement targeted retention strategies and improve customer lifetime value.

## Key Features:

* Dataset: Utilize a real-world banking customer dataset ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling)).
* Data Preprocessing: Apply cleaning, feature engineering, and scaling techniques to prepare the data for model training.
* Model Development: Build and train an ANN model with appropriate architecture and hyperparameters.
* Evaluation Metrics: Assess model performance using relevant metrics like accuracy.
* Visualization: Employ visualization tools to understand feature importance and model behavior.

## Project Structure:

The project is organized as follows:

* Data: This directory contains the Churn Modelling dataset in CSV format.
* Notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with the Python code used for data analysis and visualization.
* README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, objectives, and instructions for running the code.
